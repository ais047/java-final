Final Project report.

The turn based rpg game was a rather time consuming project for how little I
believe that came out of it. The most benefitial part would be the logic 
of the game that I can always splice out code to fit my needs if I need to 
make a similar game. I've made it very open ended to fit into a large spectrum
of rpg game. Problems this project presented me were split into pretty much
two parts. Logic, and GUI. The first part, logic was a matter of if I could 
get the program to run exactly in the way I wanted it to or not. I got stuck 
on the speed variable for a while, trying to give turn advantage to the 
character with higher speed. Instead of multiple attacks, it would give double
attacks regardless originally. As the project came closer to the end of the 
term I had to rewrite almost all of my code to fit to a gui that I made, this 
probably took 60% of the time. It was a constant battle of what can go into the
gui using what method and rewriting everything, finding it doesn't work, again
rewriting everything. I finally got a graphic setup I liked but it definetly 
took way too much time. I don't want to do this project in java again. I always
knew, but this reaffirmed to me I don't like guis. I have a bad sense of 
design.
